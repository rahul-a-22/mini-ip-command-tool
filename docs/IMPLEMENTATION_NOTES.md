# Implementation Notes for Mini IP Command Tool

## Overview
The Mini IP Command Tool is designed to provide a simple command-line interface for managing IP configurations on both Linux and Windows platforms. The tool allows users to view current IP settings, set static IP addresses, enable DHCP, change DNS servers, and reset or flush DNS settings.

## Design Decisions
1. **Object-Oriented Approach**: The project is structured using object-oriented programming principles. The main class, `IPManager`, encapsulates all functionalities related to IP management, while the `INetworkBackend` interface allows for platform-specific implementations.

2. **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: The project is designed to run on both Linux and Windows. Platform-specific functionalities are separated into different files under the `backend` directory, ensuring that the core logic remains consistent across platforms.

3. **Modular Structure**: The project is organized into distinct modules:
   - `cli`: Handles user interaction and command-line interface.
   - `include`: Contains header files for core functionalities and interfaces.
   - `core`: Implements the main logic for IP management and utility functions.
   - `backend`: Contains platform-specific implementations for network operations.

4. **CMake for Build System**: CMake is used as the build system to facilitate easy compilation and management of dependencies across different platforms.

## Workflow
1. **User Interaction**: The application starts by displaying a menu of options to the user. The user can select an option to perform various IP management tasks.

2. **IP Management**: Based on the user's selection, the `IPManager` class methods are invoked to perform the requested operation. The actual network operations are delegated to the appropriate backend implementation (Linux or Windows) through the `INetworkBackend` interface.

3. **Logging**: Actions performed by the user are logged for auditing and debugging purposes. The logging functionality is implemented in the `Utils` module.

## Potential Enhancements
1. **Enhanced Error Handling**: Implement more robust error handling to provide users with clearer feedback on failures or invalid inputs.

2. **Configuration File Support**: Allow users to save and load configurations from a file, making it easier to manage settings across sessions.

3. **GUI Version**: Consider developing a graphical user interface (GUI) version of the tool for users who prefer a visual approach to managing network settings.

4. **Additional Features**: Implement additional network management features such as network diagnostics (ping, traceroute) and monitoring tools.

5. **Unit Testing**: Expand the unit tests to cover more edge cases and ensure the reliability of the tool.

## Conclusion
The Mini IP Command Tool is a versatile and user-friendly application for managing IP configurations across different operating systems. With its modular design and potential for future enhancements, it serves as a solid foundation for further development in network management tools.
